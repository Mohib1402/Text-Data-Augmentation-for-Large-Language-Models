# Short Story: Fixing "Not Enough Data" for LLMs

This is my assignment for CMPE 297 (Special Topics). It is a review of the 2025 survey paper **"Text Data Augmentation for Large Language Models"** by Chai et al.

The project covers how we can use techniques like Prompting and Retrieval to fix small or bad datasets, rather than just using old-school word swapping.

## 📄 Project Deliverables

### 1. Medium Article (The Story)
I wrote a blog post summarizing the 4 main families of data augmentation and how to clean the data effectively.
